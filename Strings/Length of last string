//Sorry as it is a bit messy code


Problem to Solve : 

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:

Given s = "Hello World",

return 5 as length("World") = 5.

Please make sure you try to solve this problem without using library functions. Make sure you only traverse the string once.


-------ANSWER------

int Solution::lengthOfLastWord(const string A) {
    int length = 0; int i =0 ;
    
    while(A[i]!='\0') //condition to check if we are at the last of our string
    {   
        while(A[i]==' '  && A[i]!='\0') i++; //to skip the spaces
        if(A[i]=='\0') return length; 
        length = 0;
        while(isalnum(A[i]) && A[i]!='\0') {++length; i++;} //to count the length of words and store them in case it is the last word
        if(A[i]=='\0') return length;  //terminate if we have reached the end
        i++;
    }
    return length; 
}
